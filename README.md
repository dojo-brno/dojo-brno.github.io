## About us

We are an **open community** of computer programming enthusiasts, including
professional programmers and students.

We believe that learning computer programming is a continuous process that
involves **deliberate practice** and gradually pushing ourselves into mastering
new skills.

There are also important social skills involved, like **team work** and
**communication**.

In a coding dojo meeting, we work as a self-organized group to learn and share
knowledge by following certain principles and practices. For example:

- collective problem solving
- Test-Driven Development
- pair programming
- baby steps
- code refactoring
- and others...

We also keep everybody in the loop, making the environment inclusive and
welcoming for people with all sorts of background. It is a collaborative
community, not a competition.

All that happens while we solve computer programming exercises (called "katas")
in a programming language of our choice.

Join us to improve your coding skills, meet new people, learn more about
automated testing and TDD and to share your knowledge with the community.
